# Task Assessment

This project is part of the practical assessment for the Software Engineer Internship, built with React and Material-UI for the frontend, and Spring Boot with JWT authentication for the backend.

This backend system is built on Spring Boot with version 3.3.0, utilizing Java version 17. Authentication and authorization are handled using JSON Web Token (JWT) with version 0.11.2 of the jjwt-api library. On the frontend, React is employed with version 18.3.1. These technologies ensure robustness, security, and scalability for the system.
